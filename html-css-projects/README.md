Got it 👍 — since your `html-css-projects/` directory is the **hub for all your design practice projects**, the `README.md` there should explain:

1. What the folder is about
2. How the projects are structured
3. How someone can view/run them
4. A table/list of your projects (updated as you go)

Here’s a clean and professional **`README.md`** template for your `html-css-projects/` directory:

```markdown
# HTML & CSS Projects

This folder contains my practice projects from the **Jesi Software Engineering Scholarship**.  
Each project focuses on building layouts and components with **HTML & CSS**, starting simple and increasing in complexity each week.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- Each project has its own folder:
  - `index.html` → main HTML file
  - `style.css` → styles for the project
  - `assets/` → images and other resources
  - `README.md` → description, screenshot, and notes

Example:
```

project01-simple-card/
│── index.html
│── style.css
│── assets/
└── README.md

````

## 🚀 How to Run the Projects
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/jesi-software-engineering-journey.git
````

2. Navigate into this folder:

   ```bash
   cd jesi-software-engineering-journey/html-css-projects
   ```

3. Open any `index.html` file in a browser.

## 🛠️ What I’m Learning

- Structuring layouts with `<div>` and `<span>`
- Styling with CSS (colors, fonts, borders, padding, margins)
- Working with Flexbox and Grid for responsive design
- Improving project organization and clean code practices

✨ These projects represent my step-by-step growth in front-end development.
